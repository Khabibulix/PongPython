<h1>PongPython</h1>
The objective of this project is to practice the <b>Turtle Module</b> and the language <b>Python</b> by dissecting with all due respect that old game that is Pong. A very basic IA was implemented and do the job, without letting one ball go away.


<h3>Controls</h3>
<pre>
    "p" to spawn one ball or many balls
    "1" to play alone and let the IA control the <b>left</b> paddle
        "Up Arrow" to go up
        "Down Arrow" to go down
    "2" to play with a friend
        If you play with a friend, here are the controls for the left paddle:
        "z" for getting up
        "s" for getting down
 </pre>
